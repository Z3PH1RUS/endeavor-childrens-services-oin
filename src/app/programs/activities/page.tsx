                Activities are completed over time to allow children&apos;s
                comfort with the process to grow, involve family members in
                supporting children&apos;s efforts, and let children create

                Because some subjects are very sensitive, children must be made
                comfortable at all times, offered the opportunity to express
                their feelings, and allowed to substitute activities of their own
                choosing.
