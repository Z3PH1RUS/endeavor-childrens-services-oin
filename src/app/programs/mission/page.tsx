          <h2 className="mt-10">Created by Janice Neilson</h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-text-muted">
            Author Janice Neilson, drawing upon over thirty years work with
            vulnerable children in ten countries, provides comforting and
            effective aid for children dealing with identity and
            self-identification issues, whether induced by loss and trauma or by
            ordinary life.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4 text-text-muted">
            Neilson&apos;s book takes the child through increasingly deeper,
            uplifting arts activities including:

          <h2 className="mt-10">The Need for Psycho-Social Support</h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-text-muted">
            Although all children need nutrition, housing, health care, school
            and family support, they also deeply need sustained and effective
            psycho-social intervention.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-text-muted">
            Studies confirm aid workers&apos; observations that many vulnerable
            children experience depression. Programs are needed to help children
            acknowledge their loss of loved ones, gain a sense of self-worth and
            place in the world, and come to believe that they can and will have
            a future.
