      "In addition to his work, Neilson has been an active volunteer in his community. In 1980, he was a founding board member of the World Association for Children and Parents, a nonprofit child welfare agency working in four states and 10 nations, which has now placed more than 8,000 children into adoptive homes and provided child welfare services to more than 200,000 children.",

      "After leaving the Thurston County bench, Neilson was the legal and program advisor to the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Foundation, a Swiss foundation, working four months a year in rural villages of China to improve the lives of children affected by HIV/AIDS. This demonstration project worked in collaboration with UNICEF and Harvard University. Neilson also provided training on the rights of children to government officials, medical providers, and social workers in China, Thailand, Switzerland, Rwanda and India.",
